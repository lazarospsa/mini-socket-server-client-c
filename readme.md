#This project made to help other with a mini example of C socket Server / Client

The binaries compiled on MacOS with gcc(clang)
gcc src/serversocket.c -o bin/serversocket
gcc src/clientsocket.c -o bin/clientsocket

No dependancies, just C.

I don't really know if I will continue with updates on this tiny project.
